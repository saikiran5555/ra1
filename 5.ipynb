    "Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the values of two or more independent variables. It is an extension of Simple Linear Regression (SLR), which only uses one independent variable. Here's a more detailed look at MLR:\n",

    "\n",
    "SLR is simpler and only shows the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "MLR is more complex and can show the relationship between multiple factors and the dependent variable.\n",
    "Real-World Applicability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SLR is limited in real-world applicability as it can oversimplify scenarios by ignoring other relevant variables.\n",
    "MLR is more practical for complex real-life scenarios where multiple factors affect the outcome.\n",
    "Risk of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "In SLR, multicollinearity is not an issue.\n",
    "In MLR, multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables) can distort the model and make the coefficients unreliable.\n",
    "Predictive Accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "SLR may have limited predictive accuracy due to considering only one factor.\n",
    "MLR, by considering multiple factors, often provides a more accurate and reliable prediction.\n",
    "Analysis and Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "SLR is straightforward to analyze and interpret.\n",
    "MLR requires more careful analysis and interpretation, especially in understanding how independent variables interact with each other."
