    "​\n",
    " +β \n",
    "1\n",
    "​\n",
    " x+ϵ.\n",
    "Polynomial Regression: Although linear in terms of coefficients, it introduces non-linearity in terms of the independent variable \n",
    "�\n",
    "x. This allows for fitting a broader range of data shapes.\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Limited to linear relationships, which can be restrictive with real-world data often exhibiting non-linear patterns.\n",
    "Polynomial Regression: More flexible, able to model curves in the data, thus providing a better fit for many datasets.\n",
    "Risk of Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Less prone to overfitting as it has fewer parameters.\n",
    "Polynomial Regression: Higher-degree polynomials can lead to overfitting, where the model starts to capture noise in the data rather than just the underlying pattern.\n",
    "Interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Generally easier to interpret with a clear relationship between independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "Polynomial Regression: Interpretation becomes more complex, especially as the degree of the polynomial increases.\n",
    "Application Considerations:\n",
    "Degree Selection: Choosing the right degree of the polynomial is crucial. Too low, and the model might underfit; too high, and it might overfit.\n",
    "Feature Scaling: Polynomial regression can be sensitive to the scale of the features, so feature scaling (like standardization or normalization) is often necessary.\n",
    "Regularization: Techniques like Ridge or Lasso regularization can be used to control overfitting in polynomial regression models."
