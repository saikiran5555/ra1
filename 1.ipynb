    "Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression are both statistical methods used to model the relationship between independent variable(s) and a dependent variable. The key difference lies in the number of independent variables they consider.\n",

    "Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Definition: Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor) and a dependent variable (outcome) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The equation of a simple linear regression line is:\n",

    "Example: Suppose you want to predict house prices (dependent variable) based on multiple factors such as size (sq ft), number of bedrooms, age of the house, and location. Multiple linear regression would allow you to include all these variables in your model to predict the price of a house."
